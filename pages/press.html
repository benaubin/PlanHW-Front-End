        I'm a 12 year-old student who decided that homework planners sucked. So I developed a new homework planner.
    </p>
    <p class="col-sm-6">
        It started as a school project in Austin, Texas. We needed to create a project that interests us for
        the semester. It was the start of school, and I was also looking for a planner. Fast forward 6 months, and
        I made a homework planner. After even more time of active development, I've made a planner that I and other
        students love to use.
