# PlanHW-Front-End
PlanHW's open source front end

###What's PlanHW?
PlanHW is an awesome homework planner, running on an API on a server. In order to keep PlanHW user friendly and really awesome, we have made an Angularjs-based frontend. It's open source, so everyone can help build the best planner, ever.

###I want this!
Awesome! PlanHW is kind of working, but not fully. Currently all features are **free**! Although we probably won't we accepting signups until next schoolyear, it's going to be awesome.

###How can I help?
Currently, not much. If you want to do some UI work, that's awesome, but the API is not published yet. Soon, the api will be public, but currently it's only running on the developers computer :(.
You should sign up on the mailing list to get know when the api goes public (hopefully soon!).
We also hope to have some sort of funding campaign shortly, so that will help out a lot!
